# Inclusive Energy Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing energy data, particularly focusing on flow analysis and pressure measurements.

## Current Implementation
- **Data Loading**:
  - Supports CSV and Excel files
  - Handles both file paths and file-like objects
  - Automatic column detection and validation

- **Analysis Features**:
  - Multiple regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Decision Tree)
  - Support for multiple input features
  - Comprehensive model evaluation metrics

- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive plots with Plotly
  - Residual analysis
  - Correlation visualization

## Next Steps
